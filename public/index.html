      content="Body language is a form of nonverbal communication in which physical behaviors, as opposed to words, are used to express or convey information. Such behaviors include facial expressions, body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch and the use of space.

Body language exists in both animals and humans, but this website focuses on the interpretation of human body language. The interpretation of body language can be complex, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. However, there are some general tips and techniques that can be useful in understanding the nonverbal communication of others.

This website provides an overview of body language and its interpretation. It offers tips and advice on how to read and understand the nonverbal cues of others. In addition, the website provides a range of resources, including articles, books and videos, to help you further develop your understanding of this fascinating topic."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
